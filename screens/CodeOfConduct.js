        that reflects positively on the program, the Department of Recreation

        Colgate University expects each club sport student-athlete to
        adhere to a set of standards that positively represents the
        Department of Recreation and the University. The Department of
        Recreation sets forth a code of ethics for alcohol and drug
        use to clearly define its position and expectation regarding
        these issues. A club sport student-athlete is responsible for
        complying with all federal, state, University and Department
        guidelines pertaining to alcohol and drug use. This Code of
        Ethics is considered to be a minimum requirement, and club
        sport coachâ€™s and captain may set higher standards in a
        separate team policy.{'\n'}

        <Header4>Hazing</Header4>
        <BlockText>
        Colgate University policy and New York State law, strictly
        prohibit all forms of hazing, including in connection with
        initiation or continuing affiliation with a Club Sport. Hazing
        is illegal at Colgate and is therefore not to be associated
        with any clubs. Hazing is generally defined as being any
        action or activity [whether on or off campus] which recklessly
        endangers the physical or mental health or well being of
        another person or which violates the dignity of another
        person. Hazing is further defined as any activity that
        involves the forced consumption of food, alcohol or drugs or
        any other substance in the course of initiation or continuing
        affiliation with an organization. Groups which are found to
        have violated the university hazing policy as stated in the
        Colgate Student Handbook will forfeit recognition.{'\n'}
