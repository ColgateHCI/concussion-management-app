        A concussion is a brain injury that may be caused by a bump,
        blow, or hit to the head or a blow to another part of the body
        where the force is transmitted to the head. All concussions
        and brain injuries are potentially serious and often occur
        without loss of consciousness. Symptoms include (but are not
        limited to) transient confusion, disorientation, impaired
        consciousness, dysfunction of memory, loss of consciousness,
        seizures, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, headache,
        dizziness, or fatigue.

        Recreation staff member or Club Leaders, of sustaining a
        concussion or head injury while participating in a Colgate
        Recreation activity will be removed immediately from
        participation. This includes any club sport practice or game,
        intramural competition, physical education and/or outdoor
        education programming.</BlockText> 

        <BlockText>{'\n'}The individual who has been removed

        The Colgate University Club Sports Program has a
        responsibility to educate its club sport student-athletes of
        the signs and symptoms of mild traumatic brain injuries;
        otherwise known as concussions. Club Sports Presidents and
        Coach (if applicable) go through training in order to be able
        to recognize concussive-type symptoms. However, many
        concussions can go unreported. It is imperative that those
        club sport student-athletes, who suspect they may be suffering
        from a concussion, seek treatment and report to a physician.{'\n'}
