# Concussion Management App

A simple concussion management and symptom tracking app developed for my computer science honors thesis at Colgate University. Allows a student athlete to easily complete mandatory paperwork and concussion education modules before beginning their season, and quickly and effortlessly report concussive events and their resulting symptoms once they have begun playing.

**Current stage: High Fidelity Prototype**

## Next Steps / Future Improvements
### Small Fixes
* UI Issues (keyboard covers up text box on waiver, slide to report conflicts with slide to go back, tap to pick symptom rating)
* Education modules not updating on preseason home
* Make fields mandatory on forms

### Big Picture
* Overhaul symptom progress screen
* Fix navigation functionality / resolve React Nav and Redux clashes.
* Develop backend storage / login functionality
* Android compatability

### Implementation Decisions
* Decide which aspects of application are mandatory
  * Ex: Completing symptom tests is mandatory, disclosing content of tests is not.
* Develop logic for symptom test frequency / which symptoms appear in each test
